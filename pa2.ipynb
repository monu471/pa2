    "#### Q1. What is the relationship between classes and modules?\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes and modules are both ways of organizing and structuring code in object-oriented programming languages like Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "A module is a file containing Python definitions and statements. Modules can define functions, classes and variables, and can also include runnable code. Modules are used to organize related code into a single unit, and can be imported into other modules or scripts to be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "A class, on the other hand, is a blueprint for creating objects (i.e. instances) with a specific set of attributes and methods. Classes are defined within a module, and can be used to create objects that belong to that class.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, A module can contain multiple classes and other code, while a class is just one part of a module that provides a specific set of properties and methods to create objects."

    "\n",

You can create an instance attribute by assigning a value to a variable in the instance namespace using the \"self\" keyword."

    "In Python, the term \"self\" is used to refer to the instance of the class within the class definition. It is a convention and it is used to indicate that the variable or method it is associated with belongs to the class and not to any other scope."

    "#### Q6. How does a Python class handle operator overloading?\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, operator overloading allows you to define how built-in operators like +, -, *, etc. behave when used with instances of your class. This is done by defining special methods in your class with the double underscore notation, such as add, sub, mul and so on. These special methods are called \"magic methods\" or \"dunder methods\"."

    "#### Q7. When do you consider allowing operator overloading of your classes?\n",
    "\n",
    "Operator overloading is generally considered when a class represents a mathematical or logical concept that can be represented using operators, such as numbers or vectors. It allows objects of the class to be used in the same way as built-in types, making the code more readable and intuitive. However, it is important to be careful when overloading operators, as it can lead to unexpected behavior if not done correctly. In general, it is a good idea to only overload operators for classes that have well-defined mathematical or logical operations and to document the behavior of the overloaded operators clearly."
